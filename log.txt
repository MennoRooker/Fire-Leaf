A global overview of changes can be found in changelog.txt

The first thing I changed in the code was to change Dark
and Dragon type moves to physical moves and Ghost to be
special. There are 2 lines of code (include/battle.h[475])
that I changed to implement this change. This was an easy,
non-invasive step in order to test the workings of decomps.

I changed a lot of moves to be more viable and less 
annoying to use. Expecially the HMs, though I intend to
remove the need for them altogether down the road.

I changed all (or most) species to have a 50/50 gender
ratio. Breeding needs to be balanced regardless of species.

I changed around some of the pokemon stats and some types
and abilities to make certain pokémon more viable/enjoyable.
No over-the-top changes, just making some of the useless
ones usable.

I changed some of the learnsets to reflect the move changes
and to make more pokémon viable.

I added the move Quiver Dance into the game, I needed to
find the necessary files to change. First, define the move
in moves.h (include/constants/moves.h), make sure increase 
MOVES_COUNT by 1. Since Quiver Dance has a unique effect of 
increasing 3 seperate stats I needed to define a new move 
effect as well in battle_move_effects.h. The new effect 
called EFFECT_QUIVER_DANCE is defined there, but the logic
is written in battle_scripts_1.s (data). The order in which 
battle effects are written matters! If .4byte of Quiver Dance
is defined at the end of of the struct, the method needs to 
be at the end of the script.

I also changed the effect of growth to be both atk and
spatk boosting. I added a new effect for AttackSpAtkUp
that can be re-used if I want to add the move Work-Up
later down the line. Once everything is defined you can 
just add the moves to the learnsets of Pokémon. I still
need to add custom animations for Growth and Quiver Dance.

I added pokémon variety in the first few routes and I changed
some of the parties of trainers in the first area: Viridian
Forest. The trainer_parties.h file had some trainers distri-
buted randomly throughout the file. I relocated the first
few routes in order of encountering the trainers and I intend
to keep this pattern up. 

IVs were calculeted using INPUT * 31 / 255 so the INPUT would
range from 0 to 255, which is ridiculous. I changed the logic
in battle_main.c to accept values from 0 to 31. 

The wild_encounters.json file generates the wild pokémon, 
but its structure also had some weird orderinig. I relo-
cated the first routes to be at the top like for the 
trainer parties, but the encounter_rate element is above
the mons array in the firered section while it is below
the array in the leafgreen section. I added a huge blank
space between the game sections. I intend to keep version
exclusives unless trading becomes an ordeal once the cart-
ridges are actually flashed. The encounter rates per slot
are defined at the top of the json file, I might want to
refactor this sometime but I'll leave it for now.

In src/battle_script_commands.c I changes line 3166 to 
increase the global exp rate by ~17% by lowering the 
divisor from /7 to /6 to accelerate the exp gain from
all pokémon and decrease grinding slightly. I also 
intend to make the lucky egg item more accessible.

I tried to get some assets for Bugsy and other Johto
gym leaders, but they're not exactly in the format I need.
Apparently I have to somehow get the exact sprites from
the .png files I found. I added bugsy.png as an overworld
sprite in the object_events directory and I got the front 
pics of all Johto gym leaders from the Team-Aquas-Assets
repo. The fan game Fire Gold has these assets as well.
I think it's smart to see if I can add an NPC on route 22 
before I add my own sprites.

(The aide in Pewter City that gives you the running shoes 
after you beat Brock will give you the Exp. Share instead.
He will say something like: "My colleague wanted to give 
you this after catching 50 different species, but I told
him that's ridiculous!". The Exp. Share aide from the
base game will give you some other item instead.)
